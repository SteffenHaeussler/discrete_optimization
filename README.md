# discrete_optimization

This is a collection of my solutions for the [Coursera online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/home/welcome).

For every problem, there are 6 subproblems, which had to been solved.

## Problem 1: Knapsack

### Dynamic Programming

Points: 60/60

### Branch and Bound with BFS

Points: 50/60

computational time: < 10 seconds


### OR-Tools

Points: 60/60

computational time: < 10 seconds

## Problem 2: Graph Coloring
